# Account Receivable and Payable Buttons

## Purpose

Displays Receivable and Payable smart buttons, with totals, on the Partner
form.

If you click one of those, you are taken to a list of Journal Items,
totalled and grouped by their effective currencies, that contribute towards
those journal items.

## Limitations

* Isn't yet correctly deducting totals on the details screen when a part-payment has been taken.
* The Grand Total in the currency amount column will be meaningless if there is more than one currency,
  however if you group by Effective Currency then your data will be useful.
